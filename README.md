# Kubernetes Assignment - Week-6

Welcome to my **Kubernetes Assignment Repository**! This project showcases a series of hands-on tasks that cover essential Kubernetes concepts, ranging from core components like ReplicaSets and Services to advanced features like health probes and autoscaling. Each task includes a step-by-step demonstration with annotated screenshots and detailed explanations.

This repository contains a curated collection of Kubernetes tasks designed to build and demonstrate practical knowledge of container orchestration using Kubernetes. Each task is structured with clear objectives, screenshots, and step-by-step implementations.

## Task List

### **Task 1: ReplicaSet, ReplicationController, and Deployment**
Explore and deploy Kubernetes objects including **ReplicaSet**, **ReplicationController**, and **Deployment**. Understand their roles, configurations, and evaluate their respective pros and cons.
- [View Task 1](task1.md)

---

### **Task 2: Kubernetes Service Types**
Understand the different types of Kubernetes Services â€” `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, and `LoadBalancer`. Learn how services expose applications and route traffic within and outside the cluster.
- [View Task 2](task2.md)

---

### **Task 3: PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim**
Implement persistent storage using **PersistentVolume (PV)** and **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** to ensure data longevity and decoupling between storage and pods.
- [View Task 3](task3.md)

---

### **Task 4: Managing Kubernetes with AKS**
Create and manage Kubernetes clusters using **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. Includes tasks for provisioning, scaling, and upgrading AKS clusters.
- [View Task 4](task4.md)

---

### **Task 5: Liveness and Readiness Probes in AKS**
Configure **liveness** and **readiness** probes in pods within an AKS environment to monitor application health and ensure traffic is served only when the pod is truly ready.
- [View Task 5](task5.md)
---

### **Task 6: Taints and Tolerations**
Learn to apply **taints** on nodes and corresponding **tolerations** on pods to control pod placement and scheduling decisions in Kubernetes.
- [View Task 6](task6.md)

---

### **Task 7: PVC Attachment to Pods**
Attach previously defined **PersistentVolumeClaims** to pods and demonstrate the usage of persistent storage in running containers.
- [View Task 7](task7.md)

---

### **Task 8: Configure Health Probes**
Configure **liveness** and **readiness** probes in Kubernetes pods. This task demonstrates their configurations in a generic Kubernetes cluster using Nginx.
- [View Task 8](task8.md)

---

### **Task 9: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**
Implement and test **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling** based on CPU utilization. This task includes generating load to trigger autoscaling behavior.
- [View Task 9](task9.md)

---

## Summary

This assignment is a practical walkthrough of core and advanced Kubernetes topics. Each task aims to reinforce critical skills required for managing scalable, reliable, and production-ready Kubernetes applications.

Explore each task to gain deeper insights and hands-on experience!
